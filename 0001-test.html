CPSC has been collaborating with Singapore’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs through the Singapore Cooperation Program (SCP) and the ITE Education Services (ITEES) in administering this annual training program. Since 2008, it has benefited more than 200 TVET teachers and trainers in the region through the administration of more than 10 courses. CPSC facilitated the international travel of the participants to and from Singapore, as well as additional arrangements during the training program. 
</p>
<p align="justify">
The objective of the course is to allow TVET professionals and leaders to gain insights into Singapore’s policy frameworks and systems for TVET, including its experience in TVET administration and delivery, and explore holistic approaches in developing curriculum and pedagogy. Aside from the classroom lectures, the participants were also able to visit the Institute of Technical Education College West for a more hands-on experience to the facilities and training programs experienced by Singaporean TVET students.

Dr. Ramhari Lamicchane, the Director General of CPSC, supervised the program alongside Mr. Bruce Poh, Chief Executive Officer of ITE Education Services (ITEES) and Mr. William Tan, Director General of the Technical Cooperation Directorate in Singapore’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
